# 🎨 Diff Visualization Demo

Beautiful diff visualization is now implemented! Here's what we built:

## ✨ Features

### **1. Delta Integration (Primary)**
- Beautiful syntax-highlighted diffs
- Industry-standard formatting
- Automatic fallback if delta not available

### **2. Built-in Diff (Fallback)**
- Clean unified diff format
- Colored output for additions/deletions
- Works without external dependencies

### **3. Two New Agent Tools**

#### `git_diff` Tool
```typescript
// Show repository changes
git_diff({
  files: ["src/main.py"], // Optional: specific files
  staged: false,           // Optional: show staged changes
  useDelta: true          // Optional: use delta formatting
})
```

#### `diff_files` Tool
```typescript
// Compare two files or content
diff_files({
  file1: "old_version.js",
  file2: "new_version.js", 
  useDelta: true,
  context: 3
})
```

## 🎯 CLI Integration

### **Interactive Commands**
- `/diff` - Quick git diff with beautiful formatting
- `/help` - Updated help including diff commands

### **Natural Language**
- "Show me what changed in the repository"
- "Compare the old and new version of main.py"
- "What files have been modified?"

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Smart Fallback Chain**
1. **Delta** (if available) - Beautiful syntax highlighting
2. **Built-in diff** - Clean unified format
3. **Error handling** - Graceful degradation

### **Delta Features Used**
- `--features decorations` - Enhanced formatting
- `--file-style omit` - Clean headers
- `--hunk-header-style omit` - Minimal noise
- Automatic syntax detection

### **Safety & Performance**
- 5MB buffer limit for large diffs
- Temporary file cleanup
- Error handling with fallbacks
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Repository Changes**
```bash
bun run cli.js "Show me the git diff"
bun run cli.js --interactive
> /diff
```

### **File Comparisons**
```bash
bun run cli.js "Compare package.json with its previous version"
```

### **Specific Files**
```bash
bun run cli.js "Show changes in src/agents/MainCoder/tools.ts"
```

## 🎨 Visual Examples

The diff output now includes:
- 🎨 **Syntax highlighting** (via delta)
- ➕ **Green additions** with proper formatting
- ➖ **Red deletions** clearly marked
- 📄 **Context lines** for better understanding
- 🔍 **File headers** with clean styling

## ✅ What's Complete

- [x] Delta integration with fallback
- [x] Git diff with beautiful formatting  
- [x] File comparison tool
