# 🔧 Diff Visualization Fixes

Fixed the two critical issues with diff functionality:

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### **1. Display Problem: Cut-off Content**
**Problem**: Diffs were getting truncated and users couldn't see everything

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Intelligent Truncation**: Show first 70% + last 10% of lines for context
- ✅ **Clear Indicators**: Shows when content is truncated with helpful messages
- ✅ **File Saving**: `/diff-save` command to save full diffs to files
- ✅ **Enhanced CLI Formatting**: Better colors and visual indicators

### **2. Token Limit Problem: 222,065 tokens > 200,000 max**
**Problem**: Large diffs exceed Claude's token limit, causing request failures

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Smart Truncation**: Limit to 100 lines with context preservation
- ✅ **Diff Statistics**: Show overview before detailed diff
- ✅ **Helpful Guidance**: Suggest specific file viewing and save options
- ✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Multiple strategies for handling large changes

## 🎯 New Features

### **Enhanced `git_diff` Tool**
```typescript
// Now handles large diffs intelligently
git_diff({
  files: ["specific-file.js"],     // Optional: specific files only
  saveToFile: "changes.patch",     // NEW: Save to file instead of display
  useDelta: true                   // Beautiful formatting when available
})
```

### **New CLI Commands**
- `/diff` - Smart diff with truncation
- `/diff-save` - Save full diff to timestamped file
- Enhanced help with diff options

### **Smart Display Logic**
1. **Small diffs** (≤100 lines): Show complete diff
2. **Medium diffs** (100-500 lines): Show truncated with context
3. **Large diffs** (500+ lines): Recommend file saving + show summary

## 📊 Output Examples

### **Small Diff (Complete)**
```
📊 Diff Statistics:
 src/main.py | 12 ++++++------
 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)

🎨 Git Diff (via delta):
[Complete colorized diff shown]
```

### **Large Diff (Truncated)**
```
📊 Diff Statistics:
 15 files changed, 1,247 insertions(+), 832 deletions(-)

🎨 Git Diff (via delta) - Showing key changes (2,547 total lines):

💡 Large diff detected! Use `git diff > changes.patch` to save full diff to file
📁 Or ask to see specific files: "Show diff for src/main.py"

[First 70 lines...]
... [2,407 lines truncated] ...
[Last 10 lines...]

🔍 To see more:
• Ask for specific files: "Show changes in [filename]"
• Use: `git diff --name-only` to list changed files
• Save full diff: `git diff > full_changes.patch`
```

### **File Save Mode**
```
💾 Full diff saved to file: `changes_2025-01-15_1642345.patch`

📊 Statistics:
 25 files changed, 2,847 insertions(+), 1,932 deletions(-)

🔍 View with: `less changes_2025-01-15_1642345.patch` or open in your editor
```

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### **Intelligent Truncation Algorithm**
- Preserves first 70% of diff for context
- Keeps last 10% for recent changes
- Shows clear truncation indicators
- Maintains diff structure integrity

### **Token Management**
- Pre-calculates diff size before processing
- Falls back gracefully for oversized content
- Provides alternative viewing methods
- Maintains conversation context

### **Cross-Platform File Handling**
- Automatic timestamped filenames
- Safe file saving with error handling
- Cleanup of temporary files
- Multiple viewing suggestions

## 🎨 Enhanced UX

### **Visual Improvements**
- Color-coded diff sections
- Clear status indicators
- Helpful guidance messages
- Progressive disclosure of information

### **CLI Integration**
- `/diff` - Quick smart diff
- `/diff-save` - Full diff to file
- Enhanced help text
- Better error messages

## ✅ Testing Scenarios

1. **Small changes** (1-2 files, <50 lines) → Complete diff shown
2. **Medium changes** (5-10 files, 100-300 lines) → Truncated with context
3. **Large refactor** (20+ files, 1000+ lines) → Statistics + save suggestion
4. **No changes** → Clean "no changes" message
5. **Git errors** → Helpful error guidance

---

**Result**: Diff visualization now handles any size change gracefully while staying within token limits! 🎉
