# ðŸ§  Smart Context Management & Enhanced CLI UX

Successfully implemented the next phase of CLI improvements!

## âœ¨ New Features Implemented

### **1. Smart Context Management**
Keep track of what you're working on across sessions!

#### **Context Tools Added:**
- **`set_work_context`** - Remember current goals and objectives
- **`get_work_context`** - Recall what we're working on

#### **Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Set context
> "Remember that I'm working on adding authentication to the FastAPI server"
> "We're debugging the user login flow in src/auth.py"

# Get context  
> "What are we working on?"
> "Continue where we left off"
> "/context"  # Quick CLI command
```

#### **Context Features:**
- **Persistent storage** - Survives sessions and restarts
- **Goal tracking** - Remembers main objectives
- **File tracking** - Keeps track of relevant files
- **Status tracking** - starting â†’ in-progress â†’ testing â†’ complete
- **History** - Maintains work session history

### **2. Enhanced CLI UX**

#### **Slash Command Autocomplete**
- Type `/` to see available commands
- Visual hints when typing slash commands
- No more need to remember command names!

#### **New `/context` Command**
```bash
> /context    # Show current work context
> /help       # Updated help with context info
```

#### **Smart Input Handling**
- Better command recognition
- Improved visual feedback
- Contextual hints and suggestions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Context Storage**
```typescript
interface WorkContext {
  goal: string;                    // Main objective
  description?: string;            // Detailed description  
  files?: string[];               // Relevant files
  status: 'starting' | 'in-progress' | 'testing' | 'complete';
  timestamp: number;              // When started
  sessionId: string;              // Session tracking
}
```

### **KV Store Integration**
- **Current context**: `work_context_current` (7 days TTL)
- **History**: `work_context_history_{timestamp}` (30 days TTL)
- **Session persistence** across CLI restarts

### **Agent Intelligence**
- **Proactive context checking** at session start
- **Smart context updates** as work progresses
- **Natural language understanding** for context setting

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Scenarios

### **Starting New Work**
```bash
> "I want to build a user authentication system"
Agent: Sets context + starts working

> "Remember I'm debugging the login bug"  
Agent: Sets context with debugging focus
```

### **Continuing Previous Work**
```bash
> "What was I working on yesterday?"
Agent: Shows context + suggests next steps

> "/context"
Agent: Quick context summary

> "Continue with the authentication work"
Agent: Recalls context + proceeds
```

### **Project Switching**
```bash
> "Switch to working on the API documentation"
Agent: Updates context + changes focus

> "Go back to the authentication work"
Agent: Retrieves previous context
```

## ðŸ“Š Current CLI Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/help` | Show available commands | Quick reference |
| `/clear` | Clear screen | Clean workspace |
| `/session` | Start new session | Fresh conversation |
| **`/context`** | **Show work context** | **What am I working on?** |
| `/diff` | Show git diff | See changes |
| `/diff-save` | Save diff to file | Handle large diffs |
| `/quit` | Exit CLI | Goodbye! |

## ðŸš€ Benefits

### **For Users:**
- **Never lose track** of what you're working on
- **Seamless session continuity** across days/weeks
- **Better collaboration** with AI that remembers context
- **Faster re-engagement** when returning to projects

### **For Development:**
- **Focused conversations** with clear objectives
- **Progress tracking** through status updates
- **File relevance** maintained automatically
- **Historical context** for debugging and review

## ðŸ”„ Updated PLAN.md Status

- [x] âœ… **Smart Context Management** - Remember work context, continue sessions
- [x] âœ… **Enhanced CLI UX** - Slash command autocomplete, better interactions

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Next?

With context management and CLI UX complete, the **Phase 1 Enhanced CLI** is essentially done! 

**Remaining possibilities:**
1. **Project Analysis Tool** - Deep codebase understanding
2. **Advanced Git Workflows** - Auto-commits, branching
3. **Move to VSCode Extension** - Rich UI capabilities
4. **Performance Optimizations** - Speed improvements
